This paper was a product of a scientific initiation research project under orientation of Bruno de Paula Rocha, Ph.D. (BCE/CECS/UFABC) that spanned the period from May 2017 through May 2021. The authors thank the financial support granted by FundaÃ§Ã£o de Amparo Ã  Pesquisa do Estado de SÃ£o Paulo (process 2018/02696-6) from April 2018 until March 2019.

The paper aims to evaluate the refereeing behaviour in Brazilian football. Several authors have been using sports data to analyze choices in pressure environments, reporting evidence of refereeing bias in favour of home teams. Based on information from the Campeonato Brasileiro de Futebol (BrasileirÃ£o SÃ©rie A) collected from its editions between 2015 through 2017, the objective is to evaluate whether soccer referees systematically favour the home teams, assigning relatively more punishments for visiting teams. In addition, the study investigates the influence of external factors, such as monitoring and experience, on refereeing decisions.
