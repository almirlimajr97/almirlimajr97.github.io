This paper results from a scientific initiation research project conducted under the supervision of Bruno de Paula Rocha, Ph.D. (BCE/CECS/UFABC), from May 2017 to May 2021. The authors acknowledge the financial support provided by FundaÃ§Ã£o de Amparo Ã  Pesquisa do Estado de SÃ£o Paulo (grant no. 2018/02696-6) from April 2018 to March 2019.

This study evaluates refereeing behaviour in Brazilian football. Previous research has used sports data to analyze decision-making under pressure, finding evidence of refereeing bias in favour of home teams. Using data from the 2015 to 2017 editions of the Campeonato Brasileiro de Futebol (BrasileirÃ£o SÃ©rie A), this study investigates whether referees systematically favour home teams by imposing relatively more penalties on visiting teams. Additionally, it examines how external factors, such as monitoring and referee experience, influence decision-making.
