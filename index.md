## Hello, and welcome to my personal website! 👋

### About me:

- I live in São Paulo, Brazil.
- I am an economist by trade, having earned a bachelor's degree from Universidade Federal do ABC (UFABC) in 2022.
- Since September 2019, I have worked at Itaú Unibanco, currently as a data scientist for its Credit Policy team
- I am big into using data to help understand real-life problems. College and work got me hooked on data modelling, and now I am diving into Data Science.
- I am currently pursuing a postgraduate specialization in Data Sciences from Universidade de São Paulo (USP).
- I am a huge fan of sports, especially baseball (big Mets and Palmeiras fan here!).
